### Summary of Final_Summary DataFrame

As the number of rides and drivers increase the average fare per ride and average fare per driver decreases. This could 
be due to the fact that the rides take place in a more desolate area with a greater travel distance and time. The more 
densely populated areas have more rides, drivers, and shorter distances traveled which will lower fares per ride and per driver.

### Summary of Multi Line Graph for fares of each city type over time

The graph shows the weekly total fares by city type over the course of four months. Each line plot is similar in the sense that 
are rather consistent with on another as far as frequency goes. Now as you get into higher populated areas the number of rides 
and drivers increases and so do the totals per week. Urban has the highest which consists of the highest number of rides and 
drivers with the lowest average ride fare, followed by suburban and then rural. In conclusion as the population density 
increases so does the total number of drivers and fares which inversely affects the averages.
